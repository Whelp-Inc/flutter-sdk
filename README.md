# Whelp Live Chat for Flutter

[![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/whelp_flutter_sdk)](https://pub.dev/packages/whelp_flutter_sdk)

Whelp Flutter Live Chat Package is a Flutter library that allows you to integrate a live chat feature into your Flutter applications using the Whelp service.

For native Android and iOS applications, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Whelp-Inc/whelp-flutter-sdk/blob/main/doc/native_android.md" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Whelp-Inc/whelp-flutter-sdk/blob/main/doc/native_ios.md">iOS</a> documentation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

Before you use the package, you must be enrolled to [Whelp](https://whelp.co) in order to obtain an `APP_ID` and `API_KEY` on which the SDK depends on to function. 

## ü™ö Installation

To use this package, add `whelp_flutter_sdk` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  whelp_flutter_sdk: ^0.4.2
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to install the package.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

In order to be able to use media attachments in the live chat, it's required to add the following permissions to your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` for Android and `Info.plist` for iOS:

### Android

```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

### iOS

```xml
  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Camera permission is required for live chat media attachments.</string>
  <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Photo library permission is required for live chat media attachments.</string>
```

## Usage
1. Import the necessary libraries:

```dart 
import 'package:whelp_flutter_sdk/whelp_flutter_sdk.dart';
```

2. Create a `WhelpUser` instance with user information for authentication:
    
```dart
final WhelpUser user = WhelpUser(
  email: 'john@doe.com',
  fullName: 'John Doe',
  phoneNumber: '+1234567890',
  language: 'EN',
  identifier: IdentityIdentifier.email,
);
```

- Here the `identifier` is based on which the identity and uniquness of the user is determined: if matched, previous chats of the user will be loaded, otherwise a new chat will be created.  
- Either of `phoneNumber` and `email` can be null. In case both of them are null you might not be able to user's previous chat history on every new launch.

3. Create a `WhelpConfig` instance with your `APP_ID` and `API_KEY`:
    
```dart
final WhelpConfig config = WhelpConfig(
  // Replace the placeholders with your APP_ID and API_KEY
  appId: '{app_id}',
  apiKey: '{api_key}',

  // Can be Firebase Cloud Messaging token or any other unique identifier.
  deviceId: '{fcm_token}',
  disableMoreButton: true,
  disableEmojiPicker: true,
  disableSounds: true,

  // Title displayed under the header
  headerTitle: 'What do you want to talk us about?',

  // Log messages from the SDK (for debugging purposes)
  onLog: (String message) {
    log(message, name: 'WHELP');
  },

  // Status messages displayed on the header
  activeStatus: 'We are online',
  awayStatus: 'We are offline',
);
```

4. Create a `WhelpView` widget and pass the user and config as parameters and place it in your app's widget tree:

```dart
WhelpScaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text('Whelp Live Chat'),
  ),
  user: user,
  config: config,
)
```

5. Run the app, and the Whelp live chat interface will be displayed.
